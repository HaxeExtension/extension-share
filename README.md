openfl-share
============

Native Sharing calls for OpenFL

This is a simple implementation "Share" API. So far it calls the "Share Intent" on Android, a popup on HTML5 and opens sharing URL from Facebook and Twitter on iOS.

Simple use Example:
=======

```haxe
// This example show a simple sharing of a text using the Share Classs.

import extension.share.Share;

class SimpleExample {
	function new(){
		Share.init(Share.TWITTER,'', 'http://www.puralax.com/mobile/');
		// Share.init(Share.FACEBOOK,'12344123', 'http://www.puralax.com/mobile/'); // 12344123 is a random number (you should place your facebook app id here.)
	}

	function shareStuff(){
		Share.share('Hi, I\'m testing the OpenFL-Sharing extension!');
	}
}

```

=======

```bash
haxelib install openfl-share
